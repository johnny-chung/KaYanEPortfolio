          As a student educator who is going to enter the field of early
          childhood education, I would think of my role in my practice as
          co-learners with others including children, families and other
          educators. I would engage in developing mutually respectful and
          responsive relationships with children, families and other educators,
          gain more understanding about them and learn together with them, share
          my learning and experience and learn about their knowledge and
          perspectives (Ontario Ministry of Education, 2014b)/ Through
          observations, I have documented and assessed children’s play, and
          planed activities responding to their interests and skills they are
          developing. After implementing activities, I would reflect on what
          worked and what I could improve next time, and seek out information
          from multiple perspectives by sharing my observations and reflections
          with children, families and staff team. When asking feedbacks from
          children, it helps me learn more about their needs and interests,
          creative thinking and innovative ideas which are conducive for
          planning activities and enriching play. At the same time, children
          would learn that their opinions are valued and be more engaged in play
          where they have contributed their ideas. When discussing my
          observation and reflection with staff team, I learn more about how to
          adjust my strategies and the activities so support and promote full
          participation of children while meeting their individual needs based
          on their developmental level. In turn, my colleagues can also have
          better understanding of children’s interests, strengths and needs
          which is important for planning and implementing curriculum. When
          sharing my observation about children’s play with their families, it
          helps me know more about what children love to do at home and think of
          ways to connect such interests when designing next activities. In
          turn, families would learn more about what their children have done
          and experienced in the centre and find ways to support and extend
          their play after school.

          Based on my practice and the notes above, it is realized that
          additional knowledge about various kinds of strategies to accommodate
          for different needs and condition of children with flexibility when
          planning and implementing activities and helping them to regulate
          emotions and behaviour. In my future career path, I will continuously
          learn to maintain positive communication with children to understand
          their needs and interests through listening to what they talk about
          patiently and observing how they explore and interact with different
          people and materials things with respect for their choice. It is
          needed to keep on reflecting my practice, share and discuss my
          observation and reflection with the staff team and families to learn
          about how they develop strategies to respond to interests, needs and
          developmental skills of individuals and groups of children during
          play, to meet children’s individual needs, and to respond to children
          who need extra support, and how they interact with children to help
          them regulate their emotions and behaviour. Besides, I will attend
          courses and communicate with other professionals who are experts of
          supporting children with special needs to learn about how to provide
          support and guidance in response to their needs appropriately while
          facilitating their growth and development.
        </p>
        <h4>3.</h4>
        <p>
          The specific area for growth that I need to continue to work on is to
          improve and individualize strategies to promote positive interactions
          that respond to children’s needs and to shows flexibility in order to
          respond to individual needs of children while supporting and enhancing
          growth and development of the whole group of children. This connects
          to the highlights of College of ECE in the Code of Ethics and
          Standards of Practice (2017) that it is required for educators to
          “Respond to the uniqueness of individuals and groups of children. They
          identify appropriate strategies, access the necessary resources and
          design curriculum to ensure full participation of all children,
          considering ability, cultural and linguistic diversity, and Indigenous
          identity. They provide all children with opportunities for engagement,
          exploration, and expression (Standard II C, 4).
