        <p>
          As defined by the College of ECE (2017), diversity refers to
          “Differences and uniqueness that each person brings to the early
          learning and care setting including values and beliefs, culture and
          ethnicity, language, ability, education, life experiences,
          socioeconomic status, spirituality, gender, age, and sexual
          orientation (p. 23). As an ECE student and future educator, it is
          important to learn, understand and respect the uniqueness and
          difference of children and families in relation to different social
          backgrounds, cultures values, belief and experience. When planning and
          implementing learning activities and understanding and responding to
          ideas, choices in play, and experiences, it is essential to recognize
          and include cultures, backgrounds and experiences of children and
          families (College of ECE, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
          In my field placement, with respect and understanding of the
          uniqueness of children from different cultural and social backgrounds,
          I help children develop a sense of belonging and learn to appreciate
          different cultures by creating an inclusive and responsive environment
          with various learning activities infused with values of diversity and
          cultures. For example, in circle time, I have read some story books
          such as “Skin Like Mine” (Perry & Jackson, 2016) and “Where Are You
          From?” (Méndez & Kim, 2019) with elements of multi-cultures and have
          interactive discussions with children to see how the lives of
          characters are different from and similar to their daily lives. This
          can arouse children’s interests in learning and understanding the
          other cultures and make them feel connected with the daily life and

        <h3>Section 2</h3>
        <h4>Anti-racism</h4>
        <img class="float-right" src="../media/sample_8.1.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          Anti-racism refers to the ongoing process of recognizing and
          addressing racism by challenging and changing current systems,
          structures, policies, practices, behaviours, attitudes and values, so
          that power, wealth and resources can be reallocated and shared
          equitably (CARED, n.d.). To challenge and eliminate racism that is
          deep-rooted in society leading to discrimination and inequality
          suffered by the racial groups including people of colour and
          Indigenous people, one of the effective strategies is to start to make
          changes in early childhood education learning environment. As children
          become aware of racial and cultural differences and may be easily
          affected by biases learnt from the environment when they are small,
          there is a need to help children acquire “experiences that develop
          anti-bias attitudes, engage them in critical pedagogy, and teach them
          how to speak out against injustice” (Iruka et al., 2020, p. 75). It is
          important for educators to start from reflecting own biases and
          practices, examine curriculum materials to identify and address racial
          bias, and developing anti-bias and anti-racism education.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, in my field placement, I have brought and read the book of
          “All the Colors We Are” regarding physical difference about different
          race and the reasons behind (Kissinger, 2014) and the storybook of
          “The Proudest Blue: A Story of Hijab and Family?” about cultural and
          racial difference (Muhammad et. al., 2019) with children. We have
          conducted active and interactive sharing by discussing questions like
          “why people have different skin colour”, “how are we different from
          each other”, “what does Hijab mean?”, “why the children laugh at the
          girl wearing Hijab” and “What can we do if your were the girl?”. In
          this way, it helps children learn to understand the differences and
          similarities of self and others with empathy, interact with others in
          a fair and inclusive attitude and respond to biases with positive
          emotions. By creating an inclusive and caring environment with
          implementation of anti-bias and anti-racism education starting from
          early stage, children will gradually learn to respond to biases and
          challenge discrimination and inequity that the communities of color
          and minorities encounter in unbiased and positive ways.
