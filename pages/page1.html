        <h4>Element One: Connected</h4>
        <img class="float-left" src="../media/sample_4.1.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          One of the elements of curriculum design that my program planning
          addresses is “connected”. In the planning, strong connections have
          been built up amongst different learning centres (Considerations for
          Program Planning in Early Childhood Education, 2019). Based on
          children’s interest in exploring nature, various activities related to
          the theme of nature are planned and set up in different learning
          centres for children to experience and explore nature, express their
          thoughts, and represent their learning in creative ways. Children are
          provided with different opportunities to apply their learning and
          skills acquired from one area to other areas (Considerations for
          Program Planning in Early Childhood Education, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, in the Book &amp; Story centre, children will read books
          of “What do you see in spring?” (Smith, 2014) and “Are You a
          Cheeseburger?” (Arnaldo, 2021) which talk about spring activities and
          new life and growth in the natural world. Their understandings and
          curiosity about the changes brought to our mother earth in this
          wonderful season and the growth of flowers from seeds will be carried
          on to the Sensory Exploration centre and Science &amp; Nature centre
          where they experience soil, seeds and flowers by all senses and raise
          questions and investigate in science of nature, such as thinking about
          what is needed and how long does it take to grow flower. Also, they
          can represent their learning and feeling gained from activities of
          reading books of nature and exploration of natural materials to the
          Exploring Art centre through making flowers with tissue paper,
          painting and decorating garden mural and doing spring painting.
        </p>
        <p>
          When engaging these activities which are meaningful and connected,
          children are given opportunities develop and practice various skills
          in different domains of development (Considerations for Program
          Planning in Early Childhood Education, 2019). For example, when
          reading books, children develop skills of conversing with peers and
          adults (CoD # 3.4) and enjoying literacy (CoD # 3.7) in communication,
          language and literacy domain through enjoying time with books,
          discussing contents with peers and adults, and making connections to
          their play and experience related to nature and spring activities
          (Ontario Ministry of Education, 2014a). When using different art
          materials and tools to make flowers and to do painting and make
          pattern for creating gardens and scenes of spring, they are practicing
          representation skill (CoD # 4.3) and skill of identifying patterns
          (CoD # 4.18) in cognition domain and fine motor skills of tool use
          (CoD # 5.3) in physical domain (Ontario Ministry of Education, 2014a).
          When exploring the relationship of soil, seeds and flowers related to
          condition and requirements of growing plants, they can also practise
          skill of Reasoning Logically (CoD # 4.9) in cognition domain through
          relating actions to outcomes, making logical connections, exploring
          changes and making hypothesis (Ontario Ministry of Education, 2014a).

        <h4>Element Two: Meaningful</h4>
        <img class="float-right" src="../media/sample_5.1.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          The second element of curriculum design that my program planning
          addresses is “meaningful”. In the planning, curriculum is planned and
          implemented based on children’s interest that is what children know
          and care about so that they learn best through engaging in direct
          experiences and explorations related to what they are keen on and
          curious about (Considerations for Program Planning in Early Childhood
          Education, 2019). As children are interested in cooking and enjoy
          pretending to cook and serve food in dramatic play when playing with
          friends, playdough and dough tools will be provided in the Sensory
          Exploration centre and a restaurant with provision of pizza set, sushi
          set, dim sum, cooking tools and equipment will be set up in Dramatic
          Play centre. In these play areas, children can enjoy making pizzas and
          toppings in different shapes while experiencing the texture of
          playdough and ways of making different forms of playdough through
          actions of rolling, squishing, moulding, breaking and flattening. They
          can also take up roles of cooks, waiters, and customers that they are
          interested and act out ideas through interacting with peers and
          manipulating the props.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through engaging in these activities related to their interest of
          cooking and dramatic play, they can practice fine motor skills of tool
          use (CoD # 5.3) in physical domain (Ontario Ministry of Education,
          2014a) through developing and strengthening muscles used for fine
          motor movements. They can also learn to develop skill of Reasoning
          Logically (CoD # 4.9) and representation skill (CoD # 4.3) in
          cognition domain (Ontario Ministry of Education, 2014a) through
          connection their actions of handling playdough to outcomes and use of
          props and language to develop socio-dramatic play of cooking and
          serving food like pizza to peers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, as children are interested in using play foam and playdough
          to make pizza and sharing with peers, like pretending to cook and
          serve food, and enjoy mixing ingredients during activity of making
          playdough, a special event of making pancakes together with children
          is planned. They learn from process of “from the concrete to abstract”
          that is to make representation of their life and play experiences.
          Therefore, this activity is designed so that children can enjoy and in
          turn learn from the process of “from the abstract to concrete” (OPE
          Print Package, 2018-2019), that is turning what they imagine and
          pretend to do into reality through direct experience related to their
          interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this food experience, they can learn social skill of cooperating
          (CoD # 1.6) and communication skills of conversing with peers and
          adults (CoD # 3.4) (Ontario Ministry of Education, 2014a) through
          learning how to interact and cooperate with each other to handle the
          ingredients. They can practice cognitive skills of problem-solving
          (CoD # 4.2) and reasoning logically (CoD # 4.9) (Ontario Ministry of
          Education, 2014a) as they can identify difficulties, think of ways to
          solve them, and explore causes and effect from their actions and
          related outcomes. When implementing this activity, children were
          actively engaged in the process of making pancakes by getting involved
          in each step of preparing and mixing ingredients and being excited to
          observe how pancakes were cooked over griddle. They could explore
          cause and effect when connecting the action of adding more flour into
          the batter to the outcome of getting harder to stir it and observing
          the condition of water evaporating over the heating surface of
          griddle. In short, when having direct and hand on experience through
          engaging these activities which are meaningful and related on their
          interest, they can learn and construct knowledge and develop skills
          effectively.

        <h3>Section Two</h3>
        <h4>Play-based learning</h4>
        <img class="float-left" src="../media/sample_6.1.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          Play-based learning which “builds upon a child’s natural inclination
          to make sense of the world through play” (College of ECE, 2017, P.25)
          is emphasised and integrated in my program plan. Children are
          encouraged to learn through interacting with objects, people and
          information (OPE Print Package, 2018-2019). For example, in program
          plan, a number of interesting and open-ended materials including
          magnetic tiles, Legos, blocks, playdough, melty beads and clays, a set
          of food ingredients and a set of natural materials such as soil, seeds
          and flowers will be offered for children to explore, manipulate, and
          investigate.
        </p>
        <p>
          As play is "freely chosen, intrinsically motivated, and non-literal"
          (OPE Print Package, 2018-2019, p.4), this wide range of materials
          offer children choices and freedom to choose to play with those that
          can arouse their interest and natural curiosity to explore with their
          bodies, minds, and senses in different ways. During play, it helps
          stimulate their imagination and creativity, and encourage them to
          generate questions, build hypothesis, test theories, and solve
          problems. All these play experiences help them construct knowledge and
          make meaning of the world around them. For example, when using
          magnetic tiles to build different things, children will explore how
          things work with lots of questions like “why these pieces stick
          together” and “how to make balance”, and find ways to solve problems.
          Through magnetic play, they will naturally develop problem-solving
          skills, explore cause and effects and learn math concepts like
          geometry, spatial reasoning and balance. Moreover, Children can
          participate in “a selection of activities organized to facilitate
          movement, activity, choice, autonomy, communication and social
          interaction” (OPE Print Package, 2018-2019, p. 4).
        </p>
        <p>
          In program plan, a wide range of activities including “Marble maze”,
          “Floor of Lava”, “Duck, Duck, Goose”, “Hide and seek”, “What time is
          it, Mr. wolf”, “Transporting balls in spoon” will be implemented
          allowing children to choose to join in according to their interests
          and enjoy free play. When engaging in the games, children can practice
          skills of communicating, cooperating, reasoning logically and
          problem-solving through exchanging ideas, listening and responding to
          others appropriately, setting and following rules, identifying
          problems, seeking solutions and linking actions to outcomes. The
          children actively get engaged when playing the game with enthusiasm
          about setting and following rules and involving others to join in the
          game.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, as it is essential for educators to “participate in play,
          guiding children’s planning, decision-making and communication, and
          extending children's explorations with narrative, novelty and
          challenges” (OPE Print Package, 2018-2019, p. 4), I will adopt various
          strategies to support their children’s play and facilitate their
          learning in play. For example, I will stay close to observe play, take
          part in play as partner, offer praise and encouragement, provide
          guidance and suggestions to stimulate their thinking, imagination and
          creativity, and make variations to meet individual needs and
          developmental skills, enrich play by adding materials and challenges
          which are slight beyond children’s ability. It is important to be
          flexible and supportive so that children can enjoy activities and
          learn through play.
