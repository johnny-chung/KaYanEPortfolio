          In my first placement, I had worked as a Student Early Childhood
          Educator (“ECE”) in Centro Clinton Day Care Centre on Mondays and
          Tuesdays from January 24th, 2022 to February 25, 2022. The age group I
          worked with is toddler. In my second placement, I had worked as a
          Student ECE in Windermere Early Learning Centre on Wednesdays and
          Fridays from September 7th, 2022 to October 21st, 2022. The age group
          I worked with is Preschool. In my third placement, I had worked as a
          Student ECE in Elmlea Child Care Centre (George Brown Lab School) on

          2023. The age group I worked with is Kindergarten. I have gained
          valuable experience of taking caring of and playing with children
          during these three placements.

        <p>
          As a patient and friendly person, I am enthusiastic about interacting
          with children with love and care. I would learn to take their needs
          and concerns seriously and provide them with a safe space to express
          themselves and explore the world around them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, I love reading and going hiking. I would like to share the
          joy of experiencing lives of characters in the story books and beauty
          of natural environment with children. At the same time, it is Final
          Placement E-Portfolio (Curriculum and Reflection) Integrated Field
          Seminar Three 2023 40% Due: Week 6 – Sunday, April 16, 2023 hoped that
          my passion of learning new things can be spread among children through
          modelling and guiding, encouraging, and joining in activities as an
          enthusiastic partner.
        </p>
        <h4>I am excited to meet everyone and look forward to working with you in the future.</h4>
