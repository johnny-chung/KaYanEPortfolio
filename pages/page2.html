        <h4>The play episode…</h4>
        <img class="float-left" src="./media/sample_1.1.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          EN, you have been engaging in dramatic play in a variety of ways by
          using different kinds of play materials. When I put a basket of Legos
          and a box of paper figures of Disney characters on the carpet, you and
          your friends came and chose your favourite characters. You put Elsa
          figure into the house that your friend built. At the same time, you
          gave me Cinderella figure inviting me to play together. Therefore, we
          moved Elsa and Cinderella turning around inside the house. When asking
          you that “What is Elsa doing with Cinderella in the house?”, you
          smiled and replied, “They are dancing”. After playing for a while, you
          seemed to have some new ideas and started to connect several blue
          Legos to form a rectangle shape base next to the house. You then put
          Ariel figure on top and made it lay down, saying, “I build a pool”. I
          was curious about why you built this and asked, “What is Ariel doing
          here? Is she swimming?”. You smiled happily and replied, “No. Ariel is
          resting in the pool”.
        </p>
        <p>
          EN, it was realized that you really loved to play with Legos and
          figures during free choice time. One day, you came to the carpet area
          and started to build something with Legos again. You seemed to have a
          plan in mind and built a house with shelter for horse to take rest and
          kitchen area where some furniture and tools were placed. You used a
          person figure to move a plate with some food in front of a cat figure
          and shared with me excitingly, “Look! Kitten is eating snacks!”. Then
          you moved the person figure holding the plate to the kitchen area,
          saying with happy smile, “Kitten finished snacks. It’s time for doing
          dishes”.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you and your friends have spent a long time playing with figures
          and building scenes for characters to do different things, I think you
          may be interested in acting the roles of characters you like.
          Therefore, I created a collection of props like crowns, hats, masks
          and tools which represented different kinds of characters from cartoon
          or movies, and various jobs from daily life, and placed them in drama
          center. When you and your friends saw these props, you all looked
          amazed. After putting the crown onto your head, you pointed the wand
          towards your friend and wave it several times, saying that “You are
          frozen now!”. Your friend who had put on Captain American mask moved
          the shield forward pretending to block your magic. You both laughed
          and continued to act out different actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          EN, even when staying outside where not many toys were provided, you
          and your friend could still think of some creative ideas to have fun.
          Your friend sat in front of something which looked like two round
          chairs built by some other children previously, saying that “I’m on
          the beach now”. When you heard that your friend invited you to join on
          the beach, you replied loudly, “Yeah sure” and came to sit in front of
          another “chair”. You sat for a while and talked with your friend,
          “Would you like to be the king or queen? I want to be the king”. Your
          friend replied, “Then I’m the queen”. You then pretended to put
          something over your head and held something in your hand, saying that
          “King has a crown and a wand. I’m protecting the people”. You and your
          friend laughed and kept on acting out things that king and queen would
          do.

        <h4>What does it mean?</h4>
        <img class="float-right" src="./media/sample_2.1.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          EN, you have been interested and engaged in block play and dramatic
          play by planning what to build, generating innovative ideas how to
          play and acting out ideas with great enthusiasm, creativity and
          imagination (HDLH: Engagement - Body, Mind, and Senses). Your active
          engagement, long attention and strong emotional response of smiling
          and laughing show that you are keen on the play and enjoy so much fun
          from your favourite activities. You have developed representation
          skill (CoD # 4.3) as you used play materials of Legos to build and
          create scenes of dramatic play and added figures into the scenes as
          imaginative props to express ideas of what the characters would do in
          the house. You have also learnt to extend dramatic play into
          socio-dramatic by taking a role in play, co-operating and negotiating
          roles with your friends, and using language and imaginative props to
          act out ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, your happiness and excitement as demonstrated by laughing
          and interactions with peers show that you have also built up a sense
          of belonging and authentic and responsive relationship with others
          when making connections and interacting with friends and teachers in
          play (HDLH: Belonging). You have developed social skill of cooperating
          (CoD # 1.6) as you were willing to participate in play by taking and
          negotiating roles, listening and responding to peers positively,
          communicating ideas and sharing materials during play. You have
          developed social skill of interacting with adults (CoD # 1.9) when
          engaging and interacting with adults in play in positive ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, you are a capable communicator who can express your ideas
          and thoughts and communicate with your friends, teachers and families
          well in many different ways (HDLH: Expression). You have developed
          skill of using verbal and non-verbal communication (CoD # 3.1) as you
          could express your ideas, respond to others, and describe the scenes,
          events, feelings or actions when manipulating figures or pretending to
          be someone to do or say something in various ways such as gestures,
          facial expression and tones with increasingly complex sentences.

        <h4>What are the possibilities?</h4>
        <img class="float-left" src="./media/sample_3.1.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          EN, your interest in and creative ideas for developing dramatic play
          could be connected to your life experience of seeing families doing
          different things such as cooking, doing dishes and feeding pets or the
          experience of watching cartoons and reading books about living place
          and lives of characters.
        </p>
        <p>
          In response to sustaining and extending your interest and skill, apart
          from continuing to observe and document your play, I will share and
          discuss with your family to help me know more about your life
          experience and suggest what other materials can be brought into your
          play associating with your experience and interest. I will also
          arrange several field trips, for example, visiting vet clinic or
          adoption center where you and your friends can learn to how to take
          care of pets, going to parks where you can observe what other families
          and children do while enjoying outdoor play and, visiting grocery
          stores or café where you can learn and observe the process of buying
          groceries, preparing food and serving customers, or visiting musical
          theatre where you can watch performance that combines songs, spoken
          dialogue, acting and dance.
        </p>
        <p>
          After conducting field trips, I will discuss with you and your peers
          about your experience, thoughts and feeling in circle time. I will
          also arrange the environment with different art, writing and play
          materials for you to think, revisit, rebuild and represent what you
          have learnt and experienced during field trips through various kinds
          of creations like drawings, models, and especially dramatic play.
          Different kinds of block materials including Legos, hollow blocks and
          building blocks in different size and shape will be provided
          motivating you to develop and implement your plans of creating scenes
          of dramatic play. Also, a variety of play materials with division of
          different themes will be placed in drama center, for instance,
          clothing and accessories for dress-up, pretend cooking tools and food
          sets, stuffed animal toys or baby dolls, tools and equipment related
          to different themes and jobs like being doctor, nurse, cooks or
          waiters.
        </p>
        <p>
          EN, I will also place some art and writing materials like playdough,
          air-dry clay, cardboard, coloured paper, crayons, markers and glue in
          art center. I think you might be interested in creating props and
          signs and adding some interesting and meaningful elements that you
          observe in daily life or from field trips into your dramatic play. For
          example, you can cooperate with your peers to make some menu or recipe
          for your café, or make labels and signs to decorate drama area and
          turn it into a vet clinic. What you have made can eventually be used
          as props to act out scenarios when taking certain roles in dramatic
          play. For example, you can pretend to be a customer reading the menu
          you make whereas your friend who dress in waiter uniform serve you in
          a café.

        <h4>My Reflection:</h4>
        <img class="float-left" src="./media/sample_1.1.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          When looking at the photos and thinking about the observations, I
          noticed that EN was actively involved in dramatic play and developing
          concepts of representation. I shared it with my student educator
          friend. We talked about EN, and it was amazing to realize that she has
          vivid imagination and creativity and can use different ways like using
          imaginative props and language to express ideas and act out the
          scenarios. It is suggested I can share my observations with your
          family to discuss what you have experienced or love to do in leisure
          time. Your home experience and culture can be brought into the
          classroom and incorporated into your dramatic play which helps enhance
          greater interest to get involved in play and reinforce your learning
          and development of social, cognition and language skills. I wonder how
          activities can be organized and what other kinds of materials can be
          added to enrich your experience, play and learning.

        <h4>How the learning story about EN’s dramatic play is assessment</h4>
        <img class="float-right" src="./media/sample_2.1.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          Learning stories can be viewed as important assessment as it is
          pedagogical documentation involving the “process of gathering and
          analyzing evidence of learning” that “make thinking and learning
          visible” and “provides the foundation for assessment for, as , and of
          learning” (Hunter, 2023, p. 18). To collect information about
          children’s learning for future analysis, interpretation and
          discussion, it is required to observe, listen and record children and
          their play experience, learning process and products in different ways
          (Hunter, 2023). With inclusion of photos and summary of notes made for
          recording and capturing individual and group play experience taken
          place both indoors and outdoors, my learning story about EN has
          recorded, described and celebrated her learning experience and process
          related to the interest in dramatic play based on my observations of
          her active engagement in favourite activities, her ideas, feelings and
          emotional response, and her interactions with different people and
          various kinds of play materials.
        </p>
        <p>
          Documentation of EN’s play becomes a visual record that makes her
          learning evident for understanding her thinking process, finding
          meaning of her actions and experiences, and evaluating her learning
          and development (OPE Print Package, 2018-2019). When looking into what
          EN has done and experienced, it is realized that through taking on
          roles and acting them out, EN use dramatic play to explore and express
          own thoughts and feelings and experience lives and surroundings.
          Regarding her learning and development, it is found that she is
          developing and practicing skills of representation, communication and
          cooperation when engaging in dramatic play and interacting with people
          and materials. All these examinations of interests, strengths, skills
          and development provide basis for program planning that is
          child-centered and play-based, exploration of possibilities and
          inquiries, reflection and modification of teaching practice, and
          discussion with children, families, and staff team (Hunter, 2023).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the learning story, through ongoing reflections and discussions
          with staff teams and families, I have explored a number of
          possibilities which can be incorporated into program plans and more
          responsive to EN’s needs, interests and skills. For instance, various
          activities including fieldtrips and follow-up discussions with
          arrangement of play areas, provision of different kinds of play
          materials and inclusion of home culture and experience will be planned
          and implemented to create an inclusive and responsive environment with
          interactive experience. Moreover, EN’s learning story shared with
          families and displayed in center allows families and visitors to know
          more about the child’s playing experience and learning condition in
          the program and provide feedback as it serves as a documentation that
          make what children do, think and learn and how the program takes this
          important aspect into consideration become visible and evident for
          families and visitors to the center (OPE Print Package, 2018-2019).
        </p>
        <p>
          The way of making children’s learning and understanding visible can
          invite communication and contribution of different parties including
          children, families, educators and communities that help facilitate
          children’s growth and development and strengthen connections with
          families and communities.
